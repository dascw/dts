# dts - Developer Tool Set

A bundle of frequently used tricks in C++, enjoyable code snippets found in books, and general investigative C++.

## Why 'dts'? 

This was originally named 'def', for 'default engineer functionality'. As I wanted it to reflect the functionality and design aspects to the STL and members of the std:: namespace, I thought `dts::` (`std` backwards) would be a better choice. I noticed after the fact that this also stands for 'Developer ToolSet'.

## Features

The original intention of this extension was to allow the trimming of whitespace to be performed on the execution of a file save, emulating existing functionality in Sublime Text 2/3.

To provide more modularity and maleability, the extension now reads the desired commands from `'commands.json'`.

The command can be binded to any key. Follow VS Code's instructions on keybinding.

## Examples

The default commands in `'commands.json'` are `'editor.action.trimTrailingWhitespace'` and `'workbench.action.files.save'`.
