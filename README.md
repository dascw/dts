# dts - Developer Tool Set

A bundle of frequently used tricks in C++, enjoyable code snippets found in books, and general investigative C++.

## Why 'dts'? 

This was originally named **'def'**, for **'default engineer functionality'**. As I wanted it to reflect the functionality and design aspects found in the STL and members of the std:: namespace, I thought `dts::` (`std::` backwards) would be a better choice. I noticed after the fact that this also stands for **'Developer ToolSet'**.

## Examples

For examples for each module, refer to the header comments and relevant unit test. 

## Requirements

- C++11 (C++17 for all functionality).

## Known Issues

- None

## Release Notes

### 0.2a

Added dts::enumerate - based on Python's for in range enumerate method.
